##GitHub API Task

The goal of this task was to understand the use of JSON, and mustache.js in the context of web development.
The app aims to pull information on a particular user's GitHub account - in this case the number of followers and following the user has.

The app is capable of showing error messages if the input is not a valid user name. And it is possible to remove generated information on the app.

This task was set by [Alex Peattie](https://github.com/alexpeattie) as part of [Makers Academy](http://makersacademy.com/)'s Week 8 tasks.
